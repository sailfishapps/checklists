Checklists is a simple Sailfish app that assists pilots with completing their checklists.
It is still beta. Only for testing and for looking at, or re-using code.
For (starting) developers there are some examples of handling ListViews and C++2QML communication.
Also, there is a mixed style of the GUI. For in-cockpit use a (non-Sailfish) high-contrast color scheme is used.
For other use, the standard sailfish Gui is used.

The data of the app are checklists. See the checklists directory.
Checklists are plain text files. 
A set of checks are always preceded by a heading. 
A heading starts with an "*".
Each check end with newline.
If you want rows within one check, use an ";"



copy data files: 
scp -r -P 2223 (yourDir)/checklists/checklistsdata nemo@localhost:/home/nemo
to remove the data:
ssh -p 2223 nemo@localhost (passw=nemo)
rm -r checklistsdata
